# 📝 To-Do List Web App

A clean and functional To-Do List app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, remove individual tasks, or clear the input field. The app offers a responsive layout and interactive task management experience.

## 🔧 Features

- Add tasks by clicking the **Add Task** button or pressing **Enter**
- Mark tasks as complete by clicking on them
- Remove tasks by clicking the ❌ icon
- Clear the input field with the **Clear** button
- Responsive design with modern styling
- Custom task check icons

## 📸 UI Preview

## 📁 Project Structure


## 💡 How It Works

- Tasks are added to a list as `<li>` elements
- Each task includes a delete (`<span>`) icon
- When clicked, the task toggles a `checked` class (strikethrough)
- The `clear` button only clears the input field, not the tasks

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **Font Awesome** (for icons)
- **Bootstrap Bundle (Optional)** – loaded via CDN

## 🔍 Code Highlights

- DOM manipulation using `document.createElement()`
- Event delegation for handling list item interactions
- Input validation before adding tasks
- Responsive layout using Flexbox

Let me know if you'd like this to include **local storage**, **dark mode toggle**, or **task filtering** as a next step to enhance the project and README!
